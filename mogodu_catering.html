         <h1>About the Mobile Kitchen</h1>
         <p>After many years of planing and saving, Mogodu Monday hit the road,
            literally, with the purchase of a party-on-wheels truck with a
            custom-built sound system, plasma screen and restaurant-grade kitchen
            that provides street food such as smash burgers, New York-style hot dogs
            and gourmet ‘boerie’ rolls. After a
            thorough DIY fittings (trust us!) the truck was retrofitted into a
            classic commercial kitchen with state-of-the art equipment.</p>
         <p>The Mobile kitchen allows us to accommodate all demands, ranging
            from large corporate catering events to private dining parties.
            Just save us a parking space.</p>
      </aside>
      <p>A mobile restaurant is a great alternative for catering your
         wedding, event, or party. We do more than just deliver, we
         prepare your food from fresh ingredients and deliver it hot.
         Mogodu Monday is ideal for those venues that lack an
         on-site food concession.</p>
      <p>Consider us for:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Weddings</li>
         <li>Fund raisers</li>
         <li>Imemulo Events</li>
         <li>Birthday Parties</li>
         <li>Imikhehlo Events</li>
         <li>... and much more!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Choose from our standard catering menu or call us to develop a
         customized menu for your special party or event. We're fast and
         we're flexible.</p>
